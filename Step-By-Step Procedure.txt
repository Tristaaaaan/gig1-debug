Here is the step-by-step procedure.

You can use ubuntu in packaging the application. I also used it before but now I use Colaboratory (lesser space required) and easier. You can search it on the internet (link: https://colab.research.google.com/)

On Colaboratory:

Step 1. Create a new notebook.

Step 2. Delete the content of sample data folder and delete the sample data folder as well. 

Step 3. Upload your code including all the assets that you use on the application. 

Step 4. Click the "+ Code".

Step 5. Enter the following commands below codes one-by-one on Colaboratory.

!pip install buildozer

!pip install cython==0.29.19

!sudo apt-get install -y \
    python3-pip \
    build-essential \
    git \
    python3 \
    python3-dev \
    ffmpeg \
    libsdl2-dev \
    libsdl2-image-dev \
    libsdl2-mixer-dev \
    libsdl2-ttf-dev \
    libportmidi-dev \
    libswscale-dev \
    libavformat-dev \
    libavcodec-dev \
    zlib1g-dev

!sudo apt-get install -y \
    libgstreamer1.0 \
    gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
    gstreamer1.0-plugins-good

!sudo apt-get install build-essential libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 bzip2 libbz2-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev openssl libgdbm-dev libgdbm-compat-dev liblzma-dev libreadline-dev libncursesw5-dev libffi-dev uuid-dev libffi6

!sudo apt-get install libffi-dev

!buildozer init

!buildozer -v android debug

**Note on Step 5: The buildozer.spec file I sent should work since it works when I packaged your application and run it on my device. 

Step 6. Once done, download the APK.

Step 7. Transfer and Install the APK on your android device.

Step 8. Check if the application runs well.

Step 9. To end, use the command below on Colaboratory if everything worked well. 

!buildozer android clean
